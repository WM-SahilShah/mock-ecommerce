## General Usage

- **Signup**
   - To access the resources, you must have a registered username

- **Login**
   - Every session must start with a login to get authenticated (for 30min at a time). You can either log in as a `user` or `admin`.
   - To get the admin credentials, contact the repo owner. There is no way to create a new admin without editing the database directly to maintain security.
   - If you are using the Swagger UI, paste the access token into the green `Authorize` button at the very top so that you don't have to keep doing it for every API call.

- **Play around!**
  - Have fun with the repo and discover API testing!
  - If your authentication runs out, simply hit the `/auth/refresh/` endpoint with the refresh token obtained in your initial login. If you cannot find it, simply log in again.
